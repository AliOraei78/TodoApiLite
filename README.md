## Day 1: Docker + Docker Compose

**Completed Today:**
- Docker Desktop successfully installed on Windows
- WSL 2 backend enabled
- First container executed: hello-world
- Verified installation with docker version, info, images, ps
- Docker Desktop running and healthy

**Key Learnings:**
- Docker containers are lightweight, isolated environments
- Image = blueprint, Container = running instance
- docker run pulls image and starts container
- No need to install dependencies locally
